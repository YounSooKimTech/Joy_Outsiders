# "Novelty Evaluation and Framing Strategies: The Outsider Challenge"

ABSTRACT. Our goal in this paper is to delve deeper into the insider-outsider dichotomy and elucidate the conditions that might enable outsiders to gain the support of relevant audiences. To this end, we draw on social identity, innovation and entrepreneurship research to study how and when innovators that vary in their degree of outsiderness can achieve recognition for their ideas. We first distinguish innovators as insiders, marginals, and outsiders to signal whether innovators come from within the target field (insider), a related (overlapping) field (marginal), a clearly distinct and unrelated field (outsider), respectively. Next, we focus on the evaluative orientation of the audience members assessing a new idea and the cultural tools (framing strategies) that the innovator can deploy to present this idea. We tested the first two hypotheses in an online experiment by recruiting participants with a degree in the life sciences, and the third hypothesis in an experiment with business students at a leading Italian University. We conclude by elaborating on the implications of our main findings for research on social evaluation, especially how audience members’ evaluative orientations shape novelty recognition.
